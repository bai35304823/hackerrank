Many simple encoding methods have been devised over the years. A common method is the ASClI character set used to display characters on the screen. Each character is given a numeric value which can be interpreted by the computer.To decode the string, first reverse the string of digits, then successively pick valid values from the string and convert them to their ASCHI equivalents. Some of the values will have two digits, and others three. Use the ranges of valid values when decoding the string of digits.For reference, the characters in s correspond to the following ASCIl values: The value range for A through Z is 65 ﻿through 90. ﻿The value range for a through z is 97 ﻿through 122. ﻿The value of the space character is 32.
Given a string, decode it following the steps mentioned above.ExampleThe table below shows the conversion from the string HackerRank to the ASCIl string 729799107101114328297110107
